# Azure subscriptions and management groups  

Subscription limits: Subscriptions are bound to some hard limitations. For example, the maximum number of Azure ExpressRoute circuits per subscription is 10. Those limits should be considered as you create subscriptions on your account. If there's a need to go over those limits in particular scenarios, you might need additional subscriptions.
